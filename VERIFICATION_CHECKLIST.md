## Solution Verification

### Problem Solved ✅
- [x] Login requests no longer trigger `AuthInterceptor`
- [x] Register requests no longer trigger `AuthInterceptor`
- [x] No `runBlocking` call on login/register
- [x] Main thread not blocked during authentication
- [x] ANR crash eliminated

### Functionality Maintained ✅
- [x] Protected endpoints still receive auth tokens
- [x] `AuthInterceptor` still works for authenticated requests
- [x] Automatic token injection for private endpoints
- [x] All existing features continue to work

### Architecture Improved ✅
- [x] Clear separation of concerns (public vs private)
- [x] Better code organization
- [x] More maintainable
- [x] Easier to understand
- [x] Testable

## Expected Behavior

### Login Flow (Public Client)
```
1. User enters credentials
2. User presses Login button
3. AuthApiService makes request
4. Public Retrofit used
5. Public OkHttpClient used (no auth interceptor)
6. Request sent without blocking
7. ✅ Response received successfully
8. Token saved to DataStore
9. User logged in
```

### Protected Endpoint Flow (Private Client)
```
1. User navigates to Habits screen
2. HabitApiService makes request
3. Private Retrofit used
4. Private OkHttpClient used (with auth interceptor)
5. AuthInterceptor retrieves token from DataStore
6. "Authorization: Bearer <token>" header added
7. Request sent
8. ✅ Response received successfully
9. Data displayed to user
```

## Final Verification

### Commits Made
1. Initial plan
2. Add qualifier annotations and update NetworkModule with public/private clients
3. Add NetworkModuleTest to verify public/private client architecture
4. Add comprehensive documentation for ANR fix
5. Add PR summary documentation

### All Requirements Met ✅
- [x] Created two OkHttpClient instances (public and private)
- [x] Public client does NOT include AuthInterceptor
- [x] Private client includes AuthInterceptor
- [x] Created two Retrofit instances (public and private)
- [x] AuthApiService uses public Retrofit
- [x] All other services use private Retrofit
- [x] Tests created
- [x] Documentation provided
- [x] No breaking changes
- [x] Minimal code impact

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

All requirements from the problem statement have been successfully implemented. The solution:
- Eliminates the ANR crash on login/register
- Maintains security for authenticated endpoints
- Is minimal, focused, and well-tested
- Is fully documented with diagrams and examples
