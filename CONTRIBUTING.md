- Keep ViewModels free of Android framework dependencies
- Use repositories as single source of truth
- Implement proper error handling
- Use Resource wrapper for API responses

### Compose Best Practices

- Keep composables small and reusable
- Use remember for state management
- Implement proper hoisting when needed
- Preview your composables
- Use Material 3 components

### Testing

- Write unit tests for ViewModels and Repositories
- Add instrumentation tests for database operations
- Test UI components with Compose test framework
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
