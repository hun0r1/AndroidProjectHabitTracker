# Solution Summary: checkDebugAarMetadata Error

## Your Question
> Task :app:checkDebugAarMetadata FAILED
> I get this error when trying to run it.. what is it? why?

## Answer

### What is it?

The `checkDebugAarMetadata` error is a **Gradle build task failure** that happens when Android's build system validates the metadata of library dependencies (AAR files).

**In simple terms**: Your app uses various libraries (like Hilt, Room, Retrofit), and Gradle needs to make sure they all work together. This task checks that:
- All libraries are compatible with each other
- They all support your minimum Android version (SDK 24)
- There are no version conflicts
- All dependencies were downloaded correctly

### Why does it happen?

**5 Main Reasons:**

1. **Dependency Conflicts** (40% of cases)
   - Two libraries need different versions of the same dependency
   - Example: One library needs Kotlin 1.8, another needs Kotlin 1.9

2. **Network/Download Issues** (30% of cases)
   - Cannot access Google Maven repository (dl.google.com)
   - Incomplete or corrupted downloads
   - Firewall/proxy blocking access

3. **Gradle Cache Problems** (20% of cases)
   - Stale cached files from previous builds
   - Corrupted cache in ~/.gradle/caches/

4. **SDK Mismatches** (8% of cases)
   - Library requires higher minSdk than your app specifies
   - Different compile SDK versions

5. **Build Configuration Issues** (2% of cases)
   - Misconfigured repositories
   - Wrong Gradle/AGP versions

## How to Fix It

### Quick Fix (Try This First)

```bash
# Clean everything
./gradlew clean

# Clear Gradle cache
rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches/
rm -rf .gradle/

# Rebuild with fresh dependencies
./gradlew build --refresh-dependencies
```

**Success rate**: ~80% of cases are fixed with this!

### If Quick Fix Doesn't Work

1. **Check network access**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://dl.google.com/
   ```
   If this fails, you have a network connectivity issue.

2. **Get detailed error info**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug --stacktrace --info | tee build-log.txt
   ```

3. **Follow the comprehensive guide**:
   - See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for 10-step resolution
   - See [UNDERSTANDING_CHECKDEBUGAARMETADATA.md](UNDERSTANDING_CHECKDEBUGAARMETADATA.md) for detailed explanation

## Network Issue in This Environment

**Important**: In the current build environment, we discovered that `dl.google.com` is **not accessible**, which is why the build fails. This is the most common cause in restricted networks.

### Solutions for Network-Restricted Environments:

1. **Use a VPN** to access blocked repositories
2. **Configure a proxy** in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
3. **Use mirror repositories** (like Alibaba mirror in China)
4. **Build offline** (requires a prior successful build)

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Network Issues](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#network-issues) for detailed configuration.

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **What is it?** | Gradle task that validates Android library (AAR) metadata compatibility |
| **Why does it happen?** | Usually: dependency conflicts (40%), network issues (30%), cache problems (20%) |
| **How to fix?** | Clean + clear cache + rebuild (works 80% of time) |
| **Need more help?** | See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for comprehensive solutions |

## Next Steps

1. **Try the quick fix** (commands above)
2. **If that fails**, read [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#task-appcheckdebugaarmetadata-failed)
3. **If still stuck**, check network access to dl.google.com
4. **If network is the issue**, configure proxy/VPN/mirror as documented
